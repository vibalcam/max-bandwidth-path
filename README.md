# Max Bandwidth Path Algorithms

We have implemented multiple algorithms for the Max-Bandwidth Path problem using Java.
More specifically, we have implemented Dijkstra's algorithm without a heap structure, Dijkstra's algorithm using a max-heap, and Kruskal's algorithm.

The maximum bandwidth path problem is a graph problem that, given a weighted graph, a source node, and a target node, seeks to calculate the path from the source to the target such that the minimum weight of the edges in the path in the path is maximized. The weights are also known as bandwidth, and the minimum bandwidth of the edges in the path is the bandwidth for the path. This problem is also known as the widest path problem or maximum capacity problem.

This problem has multiple applications, such as finding the end-to-end bandwidth between two internet nodes or finding bottlenecks in a network.
